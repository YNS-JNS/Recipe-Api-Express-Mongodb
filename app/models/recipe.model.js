  schema.method("toJSON", function() { ... }):

This line adds a custom method named toJSON to the Mongoose schema. The method is defined as an anonymous function.
const { __v, _id, ...object } = this.toObject();:

This line uses object destructuring to create a new object named object that excludes the __v and _id fields. The __v field is a version key added by Mongoose, and _id is the default MongoDB unique identifier.
object.id = _id;:

This line adds a new property named id to the object and assigns the value of _id to it. This is done to rename the unique identifier from _id to id.
return object;:

The method returns the modified object, which will be the result of calling toJSON on a Mongoose document.
In summary, this custom toJSON method is overriding the default behavior of Mongoose when converting documents to JSON. It removes the __v field, renames the _id field to id, and returns the modified object. This can be useful, especially when you want to format the JSON representation of your documents in a specific way, such as aligning with frontend expectations or excluding certain fields.

// Nb: If you use this app with a front-end that needs id field instead of _id, you have to override toJSON method that map default object to a custom object. So the Mongoose model could be modified as following code:
recipeSchema.method("toJSON", function () {
  // destructuring to create a new object named object that excludes the __v and _id fields. The __v field is a version key added by Mongoose, and _id is the default MongoDB unique identifier.
  const { __v, _id, ...object } = this.toObject();
  // adds a new property named id to the object and assigns the value of _id to it. This is done to rename the unique identifier from _id to id.
  object.id = _id;
  return object;
